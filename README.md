### Abstract

Distributed applications such as the actor model and fan-out/fan-in pattern require MPSC queues that are both performant and fault-tolerant. We address the absence of non-blocking distributed MPSC queues by adapting LTQueue, a wait-free shared-memory MPSC queue, to distributed environments using MPI-3 RMA. We introduce three novel **wait-free** distributed MPSC queues: **dLTQueue**, **Slotqueue**, and **dLTQueueV2**. Evaluation on SuperMUC-NG and CoolMUC-4 shows ~2x better enqueue throughput than the existing AMQueue while providing stronger fault tolerance.

### Motivation and Methodology

#### The Problem

MPSC queues are essential for **irregular applications**: programs with unpredictable, data-dependent memory access patterns:

- **Actor model**: Each actor maintains a mailbox (MPSC queue) receiving messages from other actors
- **Fan-out/fan-in**: Worker nodes enqueue results to an aggregation node for processing

These patterns demand queues that are both performant and fault-tolerant. A slow or crashed producer should not block the entire system.

#### Gap in the Literature

**Shared-memory** has several non-blocking MPSC queues: LTQueue, DQueue, WRLQueue, and Jiffy. However, our analysis reveals critical flaws in most:

| Queue | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| DQueue | Incorrect ABA solution and unsafe memory reclamation |
| WRLQueue | Actually **blocking** - dequeuer waits for all enqueuers |
| Jiffy | Insufficient memory reclamation, not truly wait-free |
| **LTQueue** | **Correct** - uses LL/SC for ABA, proper memory reclamation |

**Distributed** has only one MPSC queue: **AMQueue**. Despite claiming lock-freedom, it is actually **blocking** - the dequeuer must wait for all enqueuers to finish. A single slow enqueuer halts the entire system. ([Confirmed by the original author](assets/amqueue-blocking-evidence.jpg))

#### Our Approach

We adapt **LTQueue**, the only correct shared-memory MPSC queue, to distributed environments using MPI-3 RMA one-sided communication.

**Key challenge**: LTQueue relies on LL/SC (Load-Link/Store-Conditional) to solve the ABA problem, but LL/SC is unavailable in MPI.

**Our solution**: Replace LL/SC with CAS + unique timestamps. Each value is tagged with a monotonically increasing version number, preventing ABA without LL/SC.

**Key techniques**:
- **SPSC-per-enqueuer**: Each producer maintains a local queue, eliminating producer contention
- **Unique timestamps**: Solves ABA via monotonic version numbers
- **Double-refresh**: Bounds retries to two per node, ensuring wait-freedom

### Contributions

#### Findings

- **3 of 4** shared-memory MPSC queues (DQueue, WRLQueue, Jiffy) have correctness or progress issues
- **AMQueue**, the only distributed MPSC queue, is blocking despite claims of lock-freedom
- **LTQueue** is the only correct candidate for distributed adaptation

#### Novel Algorithms

| Algorithm | Progress | Enqueue | Dequeue |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| **dLTQueue** | Wait-free | O(log n) remote | O(log n) remote |
| **Slotqueue** | Wait-free | O(1) remote | O(1) remote, O(n) local |
| **dLTQueueV2** | Wait-free | O(1) remote | O(1) remote, O(log n) local |

All algorithms are **linearizable** with no dynamic memory allocation.

### Results

Benchmarked on [SuperMUC-NG](https://doku.lrz.de/supermuc-ng-10745965.html) (6000+ nodes) and [CoolMUC-4](https://doku.lrz.de/coolmuc-4-10746415.html) (100+ nodes):

| Metric | Our Queues vs AMQueue |
|--------|----------------------|
| Enqueue throughput | **~2x better** |
| Dequeue throughput | 3-10x worse |
| Fault tolerance | **Wait-free** (vs blocking) |

**Trade-off**: Stronger fault tolerance at the cost of dequeue performance.
